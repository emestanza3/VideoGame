# VideoGame

This file contains all of the work done for milestone 0 in which I edited the video game tutorial for the survival shooter.
In it is my own attempt to complete the initial tutorial given by unity as well as some slight changes. 
First My name Eduardo Mestanza will be displayed on the bottom left corenr above the health bar
Second the map has some added obstacles in the form of white marbles. They act like the obstacles placed in the enviorment
like the design of the original tutotial
The third element is that the player has a new trick up it sleve. Now the player whenever he shoots an enemy he can gain
health back. If he has full health then it will stay at full health. However if the player is damaged he can regian health
by shooting them.

To test these changes one needs to only load in the map and play the scene. The marbles placed in the terrain should act
like the normal obstacles so the player and the ai monsters are unable to go through it and can collide with them. 
This also applies to the gun from player and whenever he shoots something.
